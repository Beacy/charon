This repo contains the source code for the Obol Client, a middleware HTTP client and server for Ethereum Staking that enables HA validation through the use of the Shared Secret Validator staking model.

Obol is used by Enterprises and DAOs to distribute the responsibility of running Ethereum Validators.

## Quickstart

This repo contains the GoLang source code for the middleware, a docker-compose file for deploying the client in a local dev environment, and deployment files for deploying this client to a test cluster. To get started:

```bash
# Local development
make up
```
